## Client

This app is rendered using React. My key goals for this portfolio was to only use vanilla CSS and to implement dark mode toggling.

### App Feature

Describe key app features and how it works

``` js
// use code snippets to display work
console.log("Hello World")
```

## Bugs

- Be honest, this app has something not working right üò¨

## Future Development

There were a few coding concepts I wanted to practice when creating this project so I laid out the development process base on what I wanted to learn/practice. The initial concept was working with and rendering a larger amount of data that can be updated by a user then managing all of that in local storage.

This are the concepts I would like to practice in the future and how they effect the app

- PWA - Offline and Installable App
  - PWAs just make me happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è and many console users like their Destiny companion apps on their phone. This will give a more native app feel for those users and something neat for PC users
  - Offline support is mostly for me to learn service workers. Destiny is an online game so I don't see how many users will benefit from offline support but I can brag about it to my fiancee ü•∞
  
- JWT Authentication and Server Database
  - I have implemented many very basic user account and authentication but I would like to have something more polished and user friendly
  - With user auth, I can connect to a database so users can track their progress anywhere!
  
- Destiny API Integration
  - This would render most of the work done completely redundant but will be a huge quality of life improvement. I have many ideas for Destiny apps learning all the previous coding concepts are important for that. This will also be a good baby step for using the huge amount of data the Destiny API offers
