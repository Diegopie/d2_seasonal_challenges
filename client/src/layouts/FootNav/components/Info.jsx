                <p>I have much more respect for game developers after learning web development ðŸ˜… This stuff is hard and the Destiny API is scary! I would love to get a grip on how it works so that I can pull data straight from your accounts and remove the need for you to manually update your progress ðŸ˜ª</p>
                <p>But that is a ton of work just to learn how to use it let alone update the site to get it to work ðŸ˜¥ My focus is getting a job in web, so I have to balance learning technologies  vs making polished sites ðŸ˜’</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm leaning more on making an actual login system or giving you the ability to track Seasonal Triumphs as well. I typically play once every couple weeks so getting the most I can done in one session is critical  for me and there are a lot of Triumphs to keep up with that go away at the end of the Destiny year ðŸ˜”</p>
